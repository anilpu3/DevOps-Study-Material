List of kubectl Commands
Use the kubectl commands listed below as a quick reference when working with Kubernetes.
Listing Resources
To list one or more pods, replication controllers, services, or daemon sets, use the kubectl get command.
Generate a plain-text list of all namespaces:
kubectl get namespaces
Show a plain-text list of all pods:
kubectl get pods
Generate a detailed plain-text list of all pods, containing information such as node name:
kubectl get pods -o wide
Display a list of all pods running on a particular node server:
kubectl get pods --field-selector=spec.nodeName=[server-name]
List a specific replication controller in plain-text:
kubectl get replicationcontroller [replication-controller-name]
Generate a plain-text list of all replication controllers and services:
kubectl get replicationcontroller,services
Show a plain-text list of all daemon sets:
kubectl get daemonset
Creating a Resource
Create a resource such as a service, deployment, job, or namespace using the kubectl create command.
For example, to create a new namespace, type:
kubectl create namespace [namespace-name]
Create a resource from a JSON or YAML file:
kubectl create –f [filename]
Applying and Updating a Resource
To apply or update a resource use the kubectl apply command. The source in this operation can be either a file or the standard input (stdin).
Create a new service with the definition contained in a [service-name].yaml file:
kubectl apply -f [service-name].yaml
Create a new replication controller with the definition contained in a [controller-name].yaml file:
kubectl apply -f [controller-name].yaml
Create the objects defined in any .yaml, .yml, or .json file in a directory:
kubectl apply -f [directory-name]
You can update a resource by configuring it in a text editor, using the kubectl edit command. This command is a combination of kubectl get and kubectl apply.
For example, to edit a service, type:
kubectl edit svc/[service-name]
This command opens the file in your default editor. To use a different editor, specify it in front of the command:
KUBE_EDITOR=”[editor-name]” kubectl edit svc/[service-name]
Displaying the State of Resources
To display the state of any number of resources in detail, use the kubectl describe command. By default, the output also lists uninitialized resources.
View details about a particular node:
kubectl describe nodes [node-name]
View details about a particular pod:
kubectl describe pods [pod-name]
Display details about a pod whose name and type are listed in pod.json:
kubectl describe –f pod.json
See details about all pods managed by a specific replication controller:
kubectl describe pods [replication-controller-name]
Show details about all pods:
kubectl describe pods
Deleting Resources
To remove resources from a file or stdin, use the kubectl delete command.
Remove a pod using the name and type listed in pod.yaml:
kubectl delete -f pod.yaml
Remove all pods and services with a specific label:
kubectl delete pods,services -l [label-key]=[label-value]
Remove all pods (including uninitialized pods):
kubectl delete pods --all

Executing a Command
Use kubectl exec to issue commands in a container or to open a shell in a container.
Receive output from a command run on the first container in a pod:
kubectl exec [pod-name] -- [command]
Get output from a command run on a specific container in a pod:
kubectl exec [pod-name] -c [container-name] -- [command]
Run /bin/bash from a specific pod. The received output comes from the first container:
kubectl exec -ti [pod-name] -- /bin/bash
Modifying kubeconfig Files
kubectl config lets you view and modify kubeconfig files. This command is usually followed by another sub-command.
Display the current context:
kubectl config current-context
Set a cluster entry in kubeconfig:
kubectl config set-cluster [cluster-name] --server=[server-name]
Unset an entry in kubeconfig:
kubectl config unset [property-name]
Printing Container Logs
To print logs from containers in a pod, use the kubectl logs command.
Print logs:
kubectl logs [pod-name]
To stream logs from a pod, use:
kubectl logs -f [pod-name]
Short Names for Resource Types
Some of the kubectl commands listed above may seem inconvenient due to their length. For this reason names of common kubectl resource types also have shorter versions.
Consider the command mentioned above:
kubectl create namespace [namespace-name]
You can also run this command as:
kubectl create ns [namespace-name]
Here is the full list of kubectl short names:
Short Name	Long Name
csr	certificatesigningrequests
cs	componentstatuses
cm	configmaps
ds	daemonsets
deploy	deployments
ep	endpoints
ev	events
hpa	horizontalpodautoscalers
ing	ingresses

ns	namespaces
no	nodes
pvc	persistentvolumeclaims
pv	persistentvolumes
po	pods
pdb	poddisruptionbudgets
psp	podsecuritypolicies
rs	replicasets
